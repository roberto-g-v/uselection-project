## Title: Fraud or Fair Race on the US Election results 2020?

A deep analysis of the 5 key states that determined the results for the electoral college for 2020 elections.

## Background

The past November 3th US elections has been one of the most controversial process ever seen, not only because  of the winner or loser party results but because of the message sent to the whole world. Even though, were only 5 states the ones which historically push for one political party or the other

With this chaotic 2020 US election we would like to display a map with the overall statistics of votes US election result 2020. Also we want to show aside a  map or layer comparing different factors like Covid19, Flipping states 2016 vs 2020, Race/gender, Unemployment, Mailing votes and Historic registration that could influence the election.
Moreover with a flask we want to run a dashboard to search and display dynamic charts for any new pollbuster that wants to deep state this election. 

## Questions to resolve: 

1.	Which were the 5 key states that defined the election (flipping states) 
2.	What was the main factor that determine the vote on 2020? 
a.	Covid19?
b.	Flipping 2016 vs 2020?
c.	Race/gender?
d.	Unemployment?
e.	Mailing votes? 
f.	Historic registration vote?
3.	Based on the analysis can we imply the 2020 was fraudulent or/and Trump still has a winning scenario situation as he claims?

## Conclusions

-Main factor determining the vote switch toward Democrat party, was an important votes increase in high electoral points states, such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan, states that pushed the to 73 electoral points favoring Democrat Party.

-Also, as we mentioned, we can see the most important vote increase on Democrat Party was given by Arizona and Georgia

-During 2020 elections, the percentage of voters in voting age that made effective their vote was high in all 5 states. We can see that almost 70% of the voting age population and more voted during the process. Also is interesting to see that, contrary as affirmed by Trump's administration, even when the votes volume incresed, there was no sign of showing exceeding votes higher than the voting age electoral roll.

-So, is important to mention that fraud seems unlikely being happened!
